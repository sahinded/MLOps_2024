## Specify settings and behaviors for files

# Line ending normalization
# Windows systems uses: "crlf" \r\n (carriage return + line feed)
# Unix-based  (like Linux and macOS) uses: "lf" \n (line feed)
# end-of-line (EOL) treated as text or binary based on its content
* text=auto eol=lf
*.sh text eol=lf
*.py text eol=lf
*.md text eol=lf

# Git LFS for large files
# specify which files should be stored in Git LFS rather than directly in the Git repository
# *.jpg filter=lfs diff=lfs merge=lfs -text

# Ignoring changes
# excluded from the standard Git diff output
# (e.g., when using git diff): ignore when tracking changes
*.log   -diff
# Git not to include this file when generating an archive of the repository exports
# (e.g., when using git archive) ignored during exports
secret.txt export-ignore

# *.docx filter=custom-filter

# Custom Merge Drivers
# merge: defining how certain files should be merged during conflicts.
# *.csv merge=csv-merge-driver
# *.docx merge=word
# *.xml merge=union
# *.txt merge=union

# Attributes for Export 
# export-subst: (Version: $Version$) dynamically update version information
# version: export-subst

# Git diff attributes

# *.py indent=spaces=4
# *.js linguist-language=JavaScript
